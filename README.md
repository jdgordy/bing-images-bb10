Bing daily images source code for BlackBerry 10

## Overview
This project contains source for my "Image Tool for Bing" BlackBerry 10 app
on BlackBerry world.  This app provides an interface to recent Bing image
of the day based on the user's selected region and image dimensions.  I've
decided to make the source publicly available because I don't plan to
maintain the app going forward.

## Getting Started
In order to build the source, you'll need to install the BlackBerry 10
developer tools (Momentics IDE) and BlackBerry 10.3 SDK available at
[here](http://developer.blackberry.com/native).  I've only developed and
tested this app on physical BB10 devices, but the app should be able to run
on a BB10 device simulator available in the developer tools.

## Credits
This app leverages efforts by others to reverse engineer the Bing image of the
day APIs which provide info in XML, RSS, and JSON formats.  More information
