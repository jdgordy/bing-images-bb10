        <p><b>Overview</b></p>
        <p><em>Image Tool for Bing</em> allows you to browse the recent history of "images of the day" hosted by the Bing search engine.  Currently, Bing maintains a history of seven days worth of images and descriptions that the application lets you view, save, share, or set as your device wallpaper.</p>
        <p><b>Features</b></p>
        <p>By default, the main application page displays the current image of the day.  The following describes in more detail the action bar items:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Previous</em> - Go to the previous (older) image of the day.</li>
                <li><em>Next</em> - Go to the next (newer) image of the day.</li>
                <li><em>Show Notes</em> - Toggle display of the image description and copyright notice.</li>
                <li><em>Copy Image Link</em> - Copy image link URL to the BlackBerry device clipboard.</li>
                <li><em>Save Image</em> - Download and save the image to your device.</li>
                <li><em>Share</em> - Invoke the system share card to distribute image link URL via text, email, BBM, etc.</li>
                <li><em>Set As Wallpaper</em> - Invoke the picture editor card to edit and set the device wallpaper.</li>
                <li><em>Refresh</em> - Reload the current image of the day.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Settings</b></p>
        <p>Choose <em>Settings</em> from the application menu and adjust the options listed below, as necessary:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Refresh image list at startup</em> - Enables automatic downloading of the current image of the day when the application starts.  Disable this if you want to manually refresh images.</li>
                <li><em>Region / Language</em> - Specifies your region and language, which the Bing search engine uses to customize the current image of the day.</li>
                <li><em>Orientation</em> - Specifies the size and orientation of images downloaded to your device.  Choose a smaller image size if you wish to reduce network bandwidth (e.g., over your mobile network).  Otherwise it is recommended to choose an image size equal to or larger than your device resolution, as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>BlackBerry Z10: 768x1280 (Portrait)</li>
                        <li>BlackBerry Z3, Z30: 720x1280 (Portrait)</li>
                        <li>BlackBerry Q5, Q10, Classic: 720x1280 (Portrait) or 1280x720 (Landscape) and use the <em>Set As Wallpaper</em> action to crop the image accordingly.</li>
                        <li>BlackBerry Passport: 1080x1920 (Portrait) or 1920x1080 (Landscape) and use the <em>Set As Wallpaper</em> action to crop the image accordingly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
